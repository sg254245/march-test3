            <h1 class="section-title">Why You Should Donate</h1>
            <p>All of the money I make I donate to the 
                <a href="https://cmmhc.org/" class="highlight-link">Central Minnesota Mental Health Center</a>. 
                Their goal is to make mental health healthier through treatment, training, education, and information. 
                Mental health is just as important as physical health, yet it often gets overlooked or underfunded. 
                Struggling with mental health can be an isolating and overwhelming experience, and for many, the hardest part is not knowing where to turn for help. 
                Your donation can change that. It’s not just about providing services, it’s about showing people that their struggles matter, that they are not alone, and that help is within reach. 
                By supporting mental health care, you are helping to create a world where people can seek help without fear or shame, where mental well-being is prioritized, 
                and where everyone has the opportunity to heal and thrive.

            <h1 class="section-title">Suicide Facts</h1>
            <p>Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide and is often linked to mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. 
               Other risk factors include substance abuse, chronic illness, and major life stressors. Many people who consider suicide show warning signs, 
               such as withdrawing from others, expressing hopelessness, or having extreme mood changes. Contrary to common belief, talking about suicide does not encourage it; 
               instead, it can actually help prevent it by allowing people to seek support. Suicide is preventable, and resources like crisis hotlines, therapy, 
               and support from loved ones can save lives. If someone is struggling, reaching out can make a difference.</p>
